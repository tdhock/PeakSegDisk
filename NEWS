Remove stderr from tail since that confuses some users:
tail: cannot open .bedGraph file for reading no such file or directory
Or remove head/tail entirely for portability.

C++/R function that computes total Poisson loss using bedGraph and bed
file input -- this may be more numerically stable than the cost that
results from PeakSegFPOP. For example

there seems to be a difference between PeakSegFPOP and manual computation of the cost,
at either the fifth or sixth decimal place:
penalty                           0  5.8343554285249800245e-10   0.000172220048971656 
PeakSegFPOP -21976270.9868 80756915    -21976270.9868 95956099 -21976270.98465 982452 
manual      -21976270.9868 76085401    -21976270.9868 76085401 -21976270.98465 505615

Note above there is no difference in the manual cost between 0 and
5.8e-10, but there is a difference between the PeakSegFPOP cost, at
the fifth decimal place. This is a numerical error: the model with 0
penalty should always have at least as low of cost as any other
models. But in the PeakSegFPOP numbers, the model with penalty=5.8e-10
has a slightly lower cost.

Test via R/data.table code:
cov.dt <- fread("labels/H3K4me3_XJ_immune/samples/tcell/McGill0107/problems/chr22:16847850-20509431/coverage.bedGraph")
setnames(cov.dt, c("chrom", "chromStart", "chromEnd", "count"))
cov.dt[, chromStart1 := chromStart +1L]
setkey(cov.dt, chromStart1, chromEnd)
segs.dt <- fread("labels/H3K4me3_XJ_immune/samples/tcell/McGill0107/problems/chr22:16847850-20509431/coverage.bedGraph_penalty=5.83435542852498e-10_segments.bed")
setnames(segs.dt, c("chrom", "segStart", "segEnd", "status", "mean"))
segs.dt[, segStart1 := segStart + 1L]
setkey(segs.dt, segStart1, segEnd)
over.dt <- foverlaps(cov.dt, segs.dt, nomatch=0L)
sprintf("%.12f", over.dt[, PeakSegDP::PoissonLoss(count, mean, chromEnd-chromStart)])

DESCRIPTION: https for URL/BugReports, Suggests: markdown.

2019.12.9

Various fixes to support paths with spaces and parens.

fread(file=..) to avoid interpreting a file name with spaces as a
command.

fread.last calls normalizePath before shQuote, so that tilde is
expanded to the home dir.

fread.last works with paths containing spaces and parens.

2019.12.2

test/bugfix for PeakSegFPOP_vec, pen.num passed along to
PeakSegFPOP_df instead of always using 10.5 for penalty.

2019.9.27

db file may be specified.

2019.9.10

Change-Point pkg title for CRAN.

inlinedocs update \\t in Rd.

2019.8.9 PR#7

bugfix for fread.last on platforms which return initial whitespace.

2019.7.29 PR#6

Valgrind write(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s) fixed by not
serializing the entire PoissonLossPieceLog struct (of which there were
4 un-initialized bytes). Now we instead serialize only the members
which are necessary for decoding: max_log_mean, data_i, prev_log_mean.

ChIPreads data set.

numeric penalty value allowed for PeakSegFPOP_dir

problem.PeakSegFPOP -> PeakSegFPOP_dir

problem.sequentialSearch -> sequentialSearch_dir

future.apply::future_lapply instead of parallel::mclapply.

Vignette: examples.

Vignette showing worst case asymptotic complexity.

Vignette showing spatial correlation.

2019.6.5

do not write first up cost, which is undefined.

2019.5.24 PR#5

check Inf string for windows.

2018.12.11 PR#4

if data all the same then do not run DP.

2018.11.28 PR#2

Remove dependency on Berkeley DB.

2018.11.20 PR#3

problem.PeakSegFPOP deletes lock file before running algo.

PeakSegFPOP_disk errors (instead of crashing R) if there is a lock
file.

2018.11.14

export fread.first/last

check for empty loss/timing files

2018.10.31

Use wc/nrows/skip in fread.first/last rather than fread("head/tail -1 file")

2018.10.30

PKG_LIBS in Makevars: remove -ldb_cxx -ldb, add -pthread

2018.10.26

add -ldb_cxx -ldb to Makevars for solaris.

in SystemRequirements, link to source, name debian packages.

cast log(int) to double, const DbException& e to avoid solaris warn/err.

2018.10.25

C++ code writes number of bedGraph lines to loss file.

problem.PeakSegFPOP outputs two data.tables rather than three (timings
and loss are combined).

2018.09.28

Forked from PeakSegPipeline.

problem.PeakSegFPOP: before was checking start/end pos in segments
file with start/end pos in directory name. Now checking first/last
line in coverage.bedGraph. No longer import namedCapture.
